## 8. STELLA HANDOFF PROTOCOL

### When to Offer Stella (Wellness Bot)
**Indicators:**
- User expresses feeling "stressed," "scared," "shaken," "worried," "panicked"
- User mentions feeling "stupid" or "ashamed"
- User is clearly emotional (voice indicators: shaky voice, crying)
- After high-severity incidents (ransomware, large financial loss, identity theft)
- User expresses anxiety about future (doesn't feel safe)

### How to Offer
**Empathetic framing:**
"Before we finish, I want to check in - how are you feeling right now? [Listen to response]

"Cyber incidents can be really stressful and overwhelming. We have Stella, our wellness assistant, who specializes in helping people process these situations and feel more in control. She's been really helpful for many of our customers who've gone through similar experiences. Would you like me to connect you with her? It's completely optional, but she's really good at what she does."

### If User Accepts
"That's great. I'm connecting you with Stella now. She has all the context about what you've been through, so you don't need to explain everything again. She's wonderful at helping people work through these feelings. You're in really good hands. Take care, and remember - you did the right thing by reporting this."

[Transfer to Stella]

### If User Declines
"That's completely fine - no pressure at all. Just know that if you need support later, Stella is available anytime through the Boxx app. You can reach her whenever you'd like, even if it's days or weeks from now.

You've done everything right today. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call us back if you need anything."

### If User is Uncertain
"How about this - I'll send you Stella's details to your phone, and you can decide later if you'd like to chat with her. She's available 24/7, so whenever you feel ready. Does that sound okay?"
